# Overview of the Project
## Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION on Recruitment dataset
## Objective
1. To implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. 
2. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set.
3. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
